## **Folder Structure**

This repository is organized into three main folders:

### **`CAD/`**
This folder contains all CAD resources required for the project, including individual components, assembly files and installation guides.
- **`Enclosure/`**: CAD files for the protective housing of the system (old design).
- **`FINAL design/`**: Finalized design files representing the complete system. Refer to this folder for the final design with BOM and installation guide.
- **`Motor Mount/`**: CAD models and technical drawings for mounting the motor (old designs).
- **`Motor/`**: CAD models of the CubeMars AK80-9 motor.
- **`Template/`**: CAD model of driver template for compliance with FSAE rules.
- **`Wedge Model/`**: CAD models of wedge plate (old designs).

### **`Documentation/`**
This folder provides insight to the development process of the project.
- **`Calculations/`**: Relevant calculations supporting the design.
- **`Competition Rules/`**: Official FSAE 2024 rules.
- **`Ideation Sketches/`**: Early conceptual sketches and ideas that led to the project’s development.
- **`Project Management/`**: Other project management resources.
- **`Reference Designs/`**: External design references used during the project’s development.
- **`Main Report`**: The primary report summarizing the project’s goals, progress and results.
- **`Project Proposal`**: Initial proposal outlining the project’s proposed objectives, scope and deliverables.

### **`Motor Control/`**
This folder focuses on the software and resources needed for motor control and implementation.
- **`Block Diagrams/`**: Visual representations of motor control architectures.
- **`NUCLEO-L476RG/`**: Ressources related to the STM32 NUCLEO-L476RG development board.
